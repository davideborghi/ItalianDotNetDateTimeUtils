## Docs generation checklist

### Introduction and scope
This markdown file aims to be an initial short guide to follow when markdown docs need to be generated and added to the repo.
Generally, every time a new release is ready, we as maintainers should update the available docs.

### Used tools
We picked the following open source [Markdown generator tool](https://github.com/ap0llo/mddocs), that is able to produce markdown files starting from targeted assemblies.
This generator offers a CLI tool that has been used to upstart the documentation that can be found under 'generated/DavideBorghi' directory.

### Guided checklist

1. Install or update the CLI tool as a .NET global tool using the following command:

    **dotnet tool install --global Grynwald.MdDocs**

2. Prepare to generate the markdown docs files:
    - To generated updated docs, bear in mind to specify the destination folder with caution, because the tool **overrides** all the speciefied folder content.
    - To keep consistency in the repository, PROJECT_ASSEMBLY_PATH should be something like _src/DavideBorghi.ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils/bin/release/netstandard2.1/DavideBorghi.ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils.dll_ and GENERATED_DOCS_FOLDER should be replaced with _docs/generated_, only bear in mind to launch the command inside the main repository directory, i.e. _ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils_.
    - With this in mind, run the following command, replacing PROJECT_ASSEMBLY_PATH and GENERATED_DOCS_FOLDER placeholders with respective values:
    
    **mddocs apireference -a PROJECT_ASSEMBLY_PATH -o GENERATED_DOCS_FOLDER**

4. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

5. As always, now you deserve to enjoy your :coffee: or :tea: or :beer:!
