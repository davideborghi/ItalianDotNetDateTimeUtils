# Davide Borghi's ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils

## Introduction

### Hello everybody!

My name is __ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils__ and I'm a class library written by [Davide Borghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-borghi-87364014a/). 
He wrote me because he was bored to copy and paste a static class in every project he was working on.

Another stubborn developer, [Massimo Serra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/massimo-serra/), also decided to support Davide with my code.

As a humble, simple and pluggable .NET Standard 2.1 utility library, my role is to help Italian developers or any developer who need support when dealing with Italian holidays (both national and customizable local ones) and work days calculations, which sometimes can be really boring!

**Even if I have a good set of unit tests, my developers are committed to extend my features and documentation too, so be patient with me, I promise, they're working hard on this things in their spare time!**

For this reason, please, feel free to file comments, open issues and, if you want, even fork my code and open pull requests: only bear in mind to check my open source licence to be nice with me.

You can find me on **[Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DavideBorghi.ItalianDotNetDateTimeUtils/)**!
